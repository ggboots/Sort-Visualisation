Logic breakdown
[-] - Visualiser is made of array elements with numbers randomised from 10-700, these value are then assign to css height values to make blocks

Bubble sort, check two values and swap them, keep iterating, and then at end, loop again O(n^2)
Insertion sort, start with second value, and compare to first, then move along, and compare that with the rest O(n^2)
